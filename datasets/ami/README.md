### Dataset Summary

The AMI Meeting Corpus consists of 100 hours of meeting recordings. The recordings use a range of signals
synchronized to a common timeline. These include close-talking and far-field microphones, individual and
room-view video cameras, and output from a slide projector and an electronic whiteboard. During the meetings,
the participants also have unsynchronized pens available to them that record what is written. The meetings
were recorded in English using three different rooms with different acoustic properties, and include mostly
non-native speakers.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- `automatic-speech-recognition`, `speaker-identification`: The dataset can be used to train a model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). The model is presented with an audio file and asked to transcribe the audio file to written text. The most common evaluation metric is the word error rate (WER). The task has an active leaderboard which can be found at https://paperswithcode.com/sota/speech-recognition-on-librispeech-test-clean and ranks models based on their WER.
